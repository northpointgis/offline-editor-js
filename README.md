offline-editor-js
=================

A prototype JavaScript toolkit for using the ArcGIS API for JavaScript offline. It manages both editing and tiles in an offline mode. It's still a work-in-progress so if you have suggestions open an issue or if you want to make a pull request we welcome your proposed modifications. 

*IMPORTANT:* If you want a full, robust offline solution then you should be using our ArcGIS Runtime SDKs for .NET, WPF, Java, iOS, Android and Qt.

This repo contains the following libraries:

- `/edit`: handles vector features and stores adds, updates and deletes while offline. Resync's edits with server once connection is reestablished
   * `offlineFeaturesManager` - Extends and overrides a feature layer.
   * `editsStore` - Provides static helper methods for working with the offline data store.
- `/tiles`: stores portions of tiled maps client-side and uses the cached tiles when device is offline
   * `offlineTilesEnabler` Extends and overrides a tiled map service.
- `/utils`: contains various helper libraries.
- `/samples`: sample apps to show how to use different aspects of the offline library capabilities.

#Workflows Supported (v1)
The following workflow is currently supported for both both features and tiles:

1) Load web application while online.
 
2) Once all tiles and features are loaded then programmatically take application offline. 

3) Make edits while offline.

4) Return online when you want to resync edits.

Using an [application manifest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Using_the_application_cache) allows you to reload and restart the application while offline. The application manifest let's you store .html, .js, .css and image files locally.

__Attachment Support__: Attachments are supported with some limitations. See documentation [here](./doc/attachments.md)


#API Doc

##offlineFeaturesManager
Extends and overrides a feature layer. This library allows you to extend esri.layers.FeatureLayer objects with offline capability and manage the resync process.

* __Click [here](doc/offlinefeaturesmanager.md) to see the full API doc for `offlineFeaturesManager`__

 
##offlineTilesEnabler
Extends and overrides a tiled map service. Provides the ability to customize the extent used to cut the tiles. See the detailed description of basemap.prepareForOffline() in the "How To Use" section below to learn different options.

##Setup Instructions

1. [Fork and clone the repo.](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
2. After cloning from github, `cd` into the `offline-editor-js` folder
3. Run `git submodule init` and `git submodule update`
4. Try out the apps in the `/samples` folder.

##Dependencies

* ArcGIS API for JavaScript (v3.8+)
* NOTE: browser limitations and technical dependencies. The offline capabilities in this toolkit depend on psuedo-persistent HTML5 capabilities being present in the browser. Go [here](doc/dependencies.md) for a detailed breakdown of the information.

* Sub-modules (see `/vendor` directory)

   * [offline.js](https://github.com/hubspot/offline) - it allows detection of the online/offline condition and provides events to hook callbacks on when this condition changes
   * [IndexedDBShim](https://github.com/axemclion/IndexedDBShim) - polyfill to simulate indexed db functionality in browsers/platforms where it is not supported (notably iOS Safari, PhoneGap, Android Chrome)
   		- IMPORTANT: There is a know [issue](https://github.com/axemclion/IndexedDBShim/issues/115) with IndexedDBShim on Safari. The workaround is to switch from using /dist/IndexedDBShim.min.js to just using IndexedDBShim.js and then modify line #1467 to a more appropriate size that will meet all your storage needs, for example: ```var DEFAULT_DB_SIZE = 24 * 1024 * 1024```
   * [jasmine.async](https://github.com/derickbailey/jasmine.async.git) - library to help implementing tests of async functionality (used in tests)

* Non sub-module based library(s)
	* [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/Esri/offline-editor-js/blob/master/lib/tiles/README.md) - library to assist with uploading and downloading of files containing tile information.
	* [grunt-manifest](https://github.com/gunta/grunt-manifest) node.js library to assist with the creation of manifest files.
